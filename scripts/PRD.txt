# Technical Architecture
- **Framework:** Astro v5
- **Styling:** LESS for CSS preprocessing, global variables for theming (light/dark), standard CSS fallback.
- **Content Management:** Decap CMS (Git Gateway/DecapBridge), content in `src/content/`.
- **Components:**
  - AboutSection.astro (for about blocks)
  - ServicesGrid.astro, ServiceCard.astro (for service listings)
  - ContactForm.astro (reused across pages)
  - CSPicture.astro, Image/Picture (for optimized images)
- **Routing:**
  - Static: Home, About, Projects, Reviews, Contact, Blog index
  - Dynamic: `/services/[...service].astro`, `/service-areas/[...city].astro`, `/blog/[...post].astro`
- **State Management:** Static site generation, no client-side state except for UI toggles (e.g., dark mode).
- **Hosting:** Netlify (adaptable)
- **Version Control:** Git (GitHub)
- **Dependencies:** As per package.json

# Development Roadmap
- **Phase 1:** Layout, navigation, LESS theming, dark mode toggle
- **Phase 2:** Service area and service page templates, about section, services grid, contact form integration
- **Phase 3:** CMS integration for services, service areas, blog
- **Phase 4:** Projects, reviews, and blog features
- **Phase 5:** SEO, accessibility, image optimization, performance
- **Phase 6:** Testing (unit, e2e), QA, deployment

# Logical Dependency Chain

# Risks and Mitigations

- **CMS Integration:** Validate content structure, provide clear CMS instructions
- **Performance:** Use Astro's image optimization, audit bundle size
- **Accessibility:** Regular audits, use semantic HTML and ARIA
- **Content Errors:** Build-time validation, CMS field constraints
