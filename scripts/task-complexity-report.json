      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Testing, QA, and Deployment task into subtasks covering: 1) Unit testing implementation, 2) End-to-end testing implementation, 3) QA processes for layout, functionality, accessibility and performance, and 4) Netlify deployment and configuration steps.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technical domains (testing, QA, deployment) with dependencies on all previous tasks. The cyclomatic complexity is high due to the many decision paths in testing and deployment workflows. The task requires both technical implementation and verification across multiple dimensions (functionality, accessibility, performance)."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Service Areas optimization task into subtasks for: 1) Template and content cleanup to remove city descriptions, 2) Responsive map width adjustments for mobile devices, and 3) Testing and verification across devices and browsers.",
      "reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity with clearly defined steps. It involves template modifications, responsive design adjustments, and cross-browser testing. The task is self-contained with no dependencies, reducing its overall complexity. The implementation details are specific and well-documented, but require careful testing across multiple devices and browsers."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the color theme implementation into subtasks covering: 1) CSS variable definition for the new palette, 2) Light/dark mode implementation with media queries, 3) Stylesheet refactoring to use variables, 4) Component-level theme application and testing, and 5) Accessibility verification and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to its sitewide impact and technical requirements. It involves defining a new theming system, refactoring all existing stylesheets, implementing light/dark mode support, and ensuring accessibility compliance. The task requires systematic changes across the entire codebase with potential for regression issues if not carefully implemented."
