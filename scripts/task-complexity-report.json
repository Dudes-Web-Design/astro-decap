      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technical domains (testing, QA, deployment) with dependencies on all previous tasks. The cyclomatic complexity is moderate to high due to the various testing paths and deployment configurations required. The task requires both automated and manual testing components, increasing its overall complexity."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Decap CMS integration task into subtasks covering initial CMS setup, Content Collection schema definition, CMS configuration updates, dynamic route refactoring, image optimization implementation, and SEO metadata integration.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to its technical breadth (CMS integration, TypeScript validation, dynamic routing, image optimization) and depth (detailed configuration requirements). The task involves refactoring existing code paths while implementing new functionality, increasing its cyclomatic complexity. The detailed test strategy and lack of dependencies suggest it's a standalone feature with significant technical scope."
