  A growing city of over 13,000, strategically located in the Nashville Basin between Nashville and Huntsville, Lewisburg is attracting new residential communities like King's Landing and Savannah Lakes. J.R. Outdoor Solutions supports this progress with essential lot development services, including professional Excavation & Site Prep and thorough Land Clearing & Grading. We implement effective Drainage Solutions to safeguard investments, particularly important given the local Lewisburg series soils with dense till layers that can cause perched water tables. We are experts in Septic Installation and timely Septic Repair & Replacement, vital for the area's infrastructure. To enhance the lifestyle here, we specialize in creating attractive Outdoor Living Spaces, quality Concrete Patios & Walkways, and durable Retaining Walls that align with the Vision Lewisburg 2035 plan.
