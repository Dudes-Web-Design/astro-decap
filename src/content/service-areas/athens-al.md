## About Athens, AL
Established in 1818 and serving as the county seat of Limestone County, Athens sits at the heart of the Huntsville–Decatur–Albertville combined statistical area. The city’s population has surged from 25,406 in 2020 to an estimated 30,904 in 2023, with projections topping 34,300 by 2025. Spanning over 40 square miles of rolling limestone and clay terrain along the Elk River, Athens presents unique site-preparation and drainage challenges that require experienced, locally-knowledgeable excavation and septic expertise.

Athens combines its rich heritage with modern growth. Residents and builders flock to the amenities of Swan Creek Park—complete with pavilions, playgrounds, tennis courts, and the scenic Swan Creek Greenway Trail—while the annual Athens Grease Festival transforms historic Court Square into a celebration of the city’s Greek roots. From trenching utilities for new commercial developments along U.S. 31 to installing or maintaining septic systems on the historic campus of Athens State University (founded 1822), J&R Outdoor Solutions delivers on-time, code-compliant services tailored to Athens’s soil conditions and rapid expansion.
